Strength:
- Started on project early, thus gave me more time to think about design and test case.
- Develop and test incrementally, I had very few bugs, and most of them are easy to fix and detect

Weakness/Problems:
- I had some minor issues with implementing a priority queue based on remaining burst time for SRTF. The online resources helped a lot.
- I'm still not quite understand Makefile
